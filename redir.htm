You arrived here via: http://bit.ly/csetz44<br />
So I get no unwanted email, to contact me, please use this scheme - email addresses can be in CAPITALS or lower case, or a mixture of both - they are all treated as if they were in lower case, they're just easier for hunans to read if they contain the occasional capital letter.<br /><br />

Please prefix the address with 'ghp44', the add the date.<br />So, if you are emailing in January 2015, the bit before the @ sign would be<br />
ghp44Jan2015<br />
followed by the @ sign<br />
followed by setzweb.com<br /><br />

<br />So, if you are emailing in August 2015, the bit before the @ sign would be<br />
ghp44Aug2015<br />
followed by the @ sign<br />
followed by setzweb.com<br />
Or  <a href='http://google.com'>do a web search</a> if you want something more interesting,</body></html>
